**QA test:** Automated smoke + manual checklist `qa/feature/0258.md`; covers happy path, prerequisite fail, save/load mid-action, controller hot-swap.  
**Failure recovery:** Any interrupted state auto-resets within 2 s; save snapshot guards against corruption.

### FR-0259 — citizen complaint log

**Category:** Settlement Management  
**Purpose:** Give players a meaningful, discoverable interaction with *citizen complaint log* that supports the Settlement Management pillar.  
**Discovery:** Surfaced via world hint, codex entry, NPC bark, or contextual prompt the first time the player is within range and meets the prerequisites.  
**Desktop controls:** Default keybind from `config/input.kbm.json` for `CIT`; rebindable; mouse hover affordance on interactable.  
**Mobile controls:** Context button appears in thumb-zone with 48 dp target; long-press for variants; gesture fallback per `input.touch.json`.  
**Controller:** Face button A confirm / X variant; glyphs auto-swap per detected pad.  
**UI state:** Idle → highlighted → focused → engaged → resolved; error toast on failed prerequisite.  
**Audio cue:** Soft confirm tick on focus; layered diegetic SFX on engage; resolution stinger on success.  
**Animation response:** Character interact anim (~0.4 s) with anticipation/active/recovery split; root motion locked if interactable is static.  
**VFX response:** Subtle outline shimmer on focus; particles on engage scaled by quality preset.  
**Save persistence:** Result stored in world state delta; idempotent across reloads; survives save migration.  
**Accessibility fallback:** Hold-to-toggle option; outline boost; audio caption; one-handed mobile path; QTE auto-complete eligible.  
**Performance budget:** ≤ 0.1 ms CPU / ≤ 32 KB GPU per active instance; pooled; LOD beyond 30 m.
